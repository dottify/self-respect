You just installed "self-respect".
Congratulations! You're officially one npm install away from pretending you have it.
Remember: actual self-respect is not included in this package.
Enjoy the placebo effect. 😎
💀 WARNING 💀
Running this function will NOT magically fix your life.
But hey, at least you can call it:
```javascript
const displayManifesto = require('self-respect');
displayManifesto();
```

Now go drink some water and maybe think about what you're doing. 🍵
# self-respect

The npm package that does exactly what it says: nothing.
Just like your actual self-respect.

## Usage

```bash
npm install self-respect
```

Once installed, you can also programmatically invoke the manifesto:

```javascript
const displayManifesto = require('self-respect');
displayManifesto();
```
